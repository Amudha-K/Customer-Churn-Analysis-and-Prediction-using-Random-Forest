# Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
## Project Overview
● This project analyzes customer churn behavior and predicts customers who are likely to churn using historical data  
● It combines SQL-based data preparation, Power BI dashboards, and a Random Forest machine learning model  
● The goal is to help businesses reduce churn by identifying high-risk customers early  

## Business Objectives
● Understand customer churn patterns across demographics, services, and contracts  
● Identify key factors influencing churn  
● Predict potential churners using a Random Forest classification model  
● Enable data-driven strategies by identifying "High Risk" customers.

## Tools & Technologies

● SQL Server Management Studio – Used to store and query customer data.  
● Python – For data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.  
● Jupyter Notebook – Interactive environment to write and run Python code.  
● Pandas – For handling and analyzing structured data.  
● NumPy – For numerical computations and array operations.  
● Matplotlib – To create visualizations and plots.  
● Seaborn – For advanced and statistical data visualizations.  
● Scikit-learn – To build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.
  

## Installation and Setup

1. Install Python (3.7 or later) and Jupyter Notebook  
2. Install the required python libraries using:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
3. Install SQL Server Management Studio (for data storage and querying)  
4. Clone this repository to your local machine
5. Load the  dataset into the SQL database and Execute SQL queries
6. Run the Python script to generate churn predictions using Random Forest

## Key Business Insights
● Customers on month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate  
● Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn  
● Fiber optic internet users have higher churn probability  
● Customers without value-added services are at higher risk  
● Certain states and age groups consistently show higher churn

## Dashboard Preview
### Page 1: Churn Analysis Summary

● Overview of total customers, churned customers, and churn rate  
● Churn distribution by gender, age group, and tenure  
● Contract type and payment method impact on churn  
● State-wise and service-wise churn analysis  
● Churn category and churn reason insights  

### Page 2: Churn Prediction Dashboard

● Total number of customers predicted to churn  
● High-risk customer distribution by age, tenure, and contract type  
● State-wise churn prediction analysis  
● Payment method and service impact on churn probability  
● Customer-level churn risk details for targeted retention actions    

## Project Outcome
● Delivered an end-to-end churn analytics solution  
● Combined SQL, Power BI, and Random Forest modeling  
● Provided actionable insights for customer retention  
● Demonstrated strong analytical and machine learning skills  

## Conclusion
This project combines data analysis and Random Forest-based prediction to identify customer churn patterns and high-risk customers. The insights derived from Power BI dashboards enable organizations to take timely actions to improve customer retention.
